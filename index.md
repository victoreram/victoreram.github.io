### Hey there!

I'm Victor.

I'm a data scientist and crypto degen.

*Where I've worked*:
- [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/), where I've built out our data science products.
- [Civis Analytics]("https://www.civisanalytics.com/") where my roles have ranged from developing ETL infrastructure, to working directly with clients to scope their needs, to deploying machine learning models.

*Where I went to school*:
I graduated from Michigan State University with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.
A once aspiring physicist, I was heavily involved in research, with stints at a condensed matter physics lab at MSU, a quantum computing lab at the University of Washington, then nuclear physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU.
Though physics stimulated my itch for problem-solving, it was the application of these methods that drove me to become a data scientist.
