### Hey there!

I'm Victor.

I'm a data practitioner with an intense curiosity for crypto. I believe public blockchains have unlocked the richest datasets open to the public. 

**web3 me**:

I'm a data scientist at [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/). My proudest contributions include:
- helping develop our [Python API client](https://github.com/coinmetrics/api-client-python), a tool for python users to access Coin Metrics data via the API.
- I helped create [datonomy](https://coinmetrics.io/datonomy/), a taxonomy for digital assets.

I graduated from Michigan State University with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.
A once aspiring physicist, I was heavily involved in research, with stints at a condensed matter physics lab at MSU, a quantum computing lab at the University of Washington, then nuclear physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU.
Though physics stimulated my itch for problem-solving, it was the application of these methods that drove me to become a data scientist.

I worked at [Civis Analytics]("https://www.civisanalytics.com/") as a data scientist and consultant. At Civis, I applied my technical skills to real-life business problems and gained an affinity for a well-constructed ETL pipeline.
