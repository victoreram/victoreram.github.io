### Hey there!

I'm Victor.

I'm a data scientist who's passionate about crypto.

I currently work at [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/) where I help build our crypto market and blockchain network data.

I used to work as an Applied Data Scientist at [Civis Analytics]("https://www.civisanalytics.com/"). 
At Civis, I collaborated with a multi-disciplinary team to develop custom apps that empower clients to make business decisions backed by data and scientific rigor. 
As a data scientist, my roles have ranged from developing ETL infrastructure, to deploying machine learning models -- all while working closely with our clients.

I graduated from Michigan State University in 2017 with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.
A once aspiring physicist, I was heavily involved in research, with stints at a condensed matter physics lab at MSU, a quantum computing lab at the University of Washington, then nuclear physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU.
Though physics stimulated my itch for problem-solving, it was the application of these methods that drove me to become a data scientist.

When I'm not professionally nerding about data science, you can catch me experimenting in the kitchen, blasting heavy metal, or climbing boulders. And probably wearing a band shirt.
