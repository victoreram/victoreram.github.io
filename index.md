### Hey there!

I'm Victor, and I'm a data scientist. 

I currently work as an Applied Data Scientist at [Civis Analytics]("https://www.civisanalytics.com/"). 
At Civis, I collaborate with a multi-disciplinary team to develop custom apps that empower clients to make business decisions backed by data and scientific rigor. 
As a data scientist, my roles have ranged from developing ETL infrastructure, to deploying machine learning models -- all while working closely with our clients to cultivate a relationship.
I've also authored white papers about various topics in healthcare, such as how persuasive messaging can [impove HPV vaccination rates]("https://civisanalytics.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HC_HPV_2019_digital.pdf"), tactics that can [improve clinical trial enrollment]("https://www.civisanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Clinical-Trials-Survey-Writeup-.pdf") and the growing demand for [virtual healthcare]("https://civisanalytics.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HC_Telehealth_2019_digital.pdf").

I graduated from Michigan State University in 2017 with a BS in Physics and a minor in Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.
A once aspiring physicist, I was heavily involved in research, with stints at a condensed matter physics lab at MSU, a quantum computing lab at the University of Washington, then nuclear physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU.
Though physics stimulated my itch for problem-solving, it was the application of these methods that drove me to become a data scientist.

When I'm not professionally nerding about data science, you can catch me experimenting in the kitchen, blasting heavy metal, or climbing boulders. And probably wearing a band shirt.
