		I'm unofficially a tech-yuppie, officially an Applied Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.civisanalytics.com/">Civis Analytics</a>. I do data science things including but not limited to: develop ETL pipelines, fine-tune machine learning models, write white-papers
		Before Civis, I was an aspiring physicist from Michigan State University, where I graduated in 2017.
		<br>
		<br>
		In my free time, I experiment in the kitchen and blast heavy metal, sometimes simultaneously.
